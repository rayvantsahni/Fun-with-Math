# Hailstone Sequence
The Hailstone sequence of numbers can be generated from a starting positive integer, n by:

  * If   *n*   is     1     then the sequence ends.
  * If   *n*   is   even then the next   *n*   of the sequence   = n / 2
  * If   *n*   is   odd   then the next   *n*   of the sequence   = (3 * n) + 1

The hailstone sequence is also known as   hailstone numbers   (because the values are usually subject to multiple descents and ascents like hailstones in a cloud).

This sequence is also known as the Collatz sequence.

According to the (unproven) Collatz conjecture, the hailstone sequence for any starting number always terminates with: `.... 4, 2, 1`.
