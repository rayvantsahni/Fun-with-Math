# Narcissistic Number
An **n-Digit** number which is the **Sum of the nth Powers of its Digits** is called an `n-Narcissistic Number`, or sometimes an `Armstrong Number` or `Perfect Digital Invariant` or a `Pluperfect` or a `Plus Perfect Number`.

The **smallest n-Narcissistic Number**, other than the trivial Single Digit numbers is `153` = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 (i.e. when n = 3).

A total of **88** narcissistic numbers exist in **base-10**.

These numbers exist for only ***n = 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38 and 39 digits***.
