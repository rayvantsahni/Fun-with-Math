# Harshad Numbers
A `positive integer` which is `divisible by the sum of its digits` is called a **Harshad Number**, also called **Niven Numbers** or, much less commonly, **Multidigital Numbers**.

For example, in the decimal numeral system, `1729` is a Harshad number since `1 + 7 + 2 + 9 = 19`, and `1729 / 19 = 91`. 

 The first few of these numbers are ***1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, 20, 21, 24, ...***
