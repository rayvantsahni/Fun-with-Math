# Attractive Numbers

A number is an `attractive number` if the **number of prime factors** (`not necessarily unique`) the number has, is also **prime**.

For example,

* The number 50, which has a prime decomposition of 2 × 5 × 5, is an attractive number since the number of prime factors it has, i.e 3, is also prime.
* The number 6615, which has a prime decomposition of 3 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 7 x 7, is not an attractive number since the number of prime factors it has, i.e 6, is not prime.
