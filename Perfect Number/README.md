# Perfect Numbers
A `perfect number` is a positive integer that equals the sum of its `proper divisors`, i.e, **positive divisors excluding the number itself**. For example, 6 happens to be a perfect number and also the smallest because its proper divisors of 6 are 1,2, and 3, and `6 = 1 + 2 + 3`.  

The discovery of such numbers is actually lost in prehistory. It is known, however, that the Pythagoreans *(founded c. 525 BCE)* studied perfect numbers for their “**mystical**” properties.

Today the usual definition of a perfect number involves its divisors, but early definitions were in terms of the '*aliquot parts*' of a number.
An aliquot part of a number is a proper quotient of the number. So for example the aliquot parts of 10 are 1, 2 and 5. 

These occur since:
* 1 = 10/10
* 2 = 10/5
* 5 = 10/2

One thing to note here is that 10 is not an aliquot part of 10 since it is not a proper quotient, i.e. a quotient different from the number itself. A perfect number was defined to be one which is equal to the sum of its aliquot parts.

Some other perfect numbers **28**, **496**, and **8,128** seem to have been known from ancient times and there is no record of these discoveries.
The first recorded mathematical result concerning perfect numbers which is known occurs in __Euclid's *Elements*__ written around 300BC.

- 6 = 1 + 2 + 3
- 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14
- 496 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 31 + 62 + 124 + 248
- 8128 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 127 + 254 + 508 + 1016 + 2032 + 4064
