# Digital Root
The digital root or digital sum of a non-negative integer is the single-digit value obtained by an iterative process of summing digits, on each iteration using the result from the previous iteration to compute the digit sum. The process continues until a single-digit number is reached.

For example, the digital root of the number `32145` is `6` because `3 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 5` equals `15` and then `1 + 5` equals `6`.

Some of the properties of digital roots are:
* If we multiply any number by 9, the digital root will always be 9.
* Adding 9 to a number does not change the digital root of that number.
* If we divide any number by 9, the digital root of that number will be the remainder.
