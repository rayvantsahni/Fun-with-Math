# The Josephus Problem
Flavius Josephus was a famous historian of the first century. During the Jewish-Roman war, he was among a band of 41 (or 39 according to some sources) Jewish rebels trapped in a cave by the Romans. Preferring suicide to capture, the rebels decided to form a circle and to kill every second person until one was left, who would then commit suicide. But Josephus, was not sold to this idea and therefore quickly calculated where he should stand in the circle to avoid being executed in this process and come out as the last man standing..

#### About the program-
This program takes in the total number of soldiers and the number of people to be skipped before the next person is executes, as inputs.

- The number of people to be skipped cannot be less than 2 and therefore having the total number of soldiers less than 2 would naturally not make much sense either.
- The program also prints the order in which each soldier is killed.
- All soldiers are given a nunmber `from 1 through n`.
