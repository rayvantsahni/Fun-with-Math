# The Josephus Problem
People are standing in a circle who have to be executed. Counting begins with the person standing at the first position the circle and proceeds around the circle in a specific direction. In this problem, every second person is executed. The procedure is repeated with the remaining people, starting with the next person in the circle, going in the same direction and skipping the same number of people, until only one person remains.
This person is the sole survivor and is free to go!
