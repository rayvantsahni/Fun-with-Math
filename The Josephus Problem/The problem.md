# The Josephus Problem
Flavius Josephus was a famous historian of the first century. During the Jewish-Roman war, he was among a band of 41 Jewish rebels trapped in a cave by the Romans. Preferring suicide to capture, the rebels decided to form a circle and to kill every second person until one was left, who would then commit suicide. But Josephus, was not sold to this idea and therefore quickly calculated where he should stand in the circle so that he can be the last person to live.
